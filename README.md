# 10. Analyzing River Thames Water Levels
Apply your data manipulation skills to time series data on water levels of the River Thames.

Working with time series data is essential to enable the analysis of trends, patterns, and seasonality in data over time, facilitating forecasting, anomaly detection, and decision-making.
In this project, you'll use your pandas data manipulation skills to analyze time series data tracking the tide levels of the Thames River over many years. You will use the dataset `10-11_London_Bridge.txt` to answer the following questions:
1. Find the mean, median and interquartile range for high- and low-tide data and save them as two separate pandas Series.
2. Calculate the annual percentage of days with very high tide levels (90th percentile of high tide days) and low-tide days (below the 10th percentile).
3. Question 3: Create a dictionary named solution with a summary of your data analysis, with these key-value pairs:
`{high_statistics: high-tide stats, low_statistics: low-tide stats, very_high_ratio: high-tide ratio data, very_low_ratio: low-tide ratio data}`
